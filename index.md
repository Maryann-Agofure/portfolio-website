# Maryann Agofure- Technical writer and communicator

## Get the scoop on me
I am a technical writer who explains technical documentation as easily as possible for various levels of users through thorough research. Empathy is one of the most vital communicative skills, so I always aim to teach concepts or explain things in the easiest way that addresses my audience's pain points without losing the context of the tools or processes.
I started learning frontend development before finding my way to the cloud and finally writing about technology concepts, tools, and processes.
My customers range from small businesses to SaaS businesses, cutting across databases, cloud computing, security, etc.

title: Maryann Agofure - Technical writer and communicator
---

## **The scoop**
I am a technical writer who explains technical concepts as easily as possible for various levels of users through thorough research. Empathy is one of the most vital communicative skills, so I always aim to teach and explain complex terms in the easiest way that addresses my audience's pain points and showcases business value without losing the context of the tools or processes.
I started learning frontend development before finding my way to the cloud and finally writing about technology concepts, tools, and processes.
My customers range from small businesses to SaaS businesses, cutting across databases, cloud computing, security, etc. Ghost-written articles are available on request.

## **Hear from people I've worked with**
- "*Maryann is a top-notch technical writer. She understands a wide variety of cloud and data engineering topics and can always put them into a business context - something I find relatively rare for technical writers. I'm thrilled to be working with her, and our clients are always very happy with her work. In fact, I hope by the time you see this she has no time to work with you because I'm keeping her so busy! If that's not a clear recommendation, I don't know what is.*" - **Kim Kelley, Founder and Principal writer, Contentric**.
- "*I had the pleasure of working with Maryann while working at StreamSets. She is a wonderful freelance writer which made for quick editing. Her published posts on our blog included various data engineering topics. Working with Maryann was simple due not only to her writing skills and attention to detail, but also her thorough communication and updates throughout each post. I highly recommend working with Maryann!*" - **Hannah Recker, Growth Marketer, Coefficient**.
